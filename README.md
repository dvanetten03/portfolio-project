## Build a Portfolio Site

### Project Overview
Given a pdf mockup of a website from a designer, translate it to a real website using your HTML and CSS skills.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

The only real prerequisite is a webbrowser. You will open your webbrowser, click on file>open and navigate to index.html to open the portfolio.

#### Notes

This portfolio will be updated with additional works as my Udacity degree continues. I only have the portfolio in here, but I looked ahead and have two additional projects, so they are placeholder names in my portfolio project as of October 2017.
